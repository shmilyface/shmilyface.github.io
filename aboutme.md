Hi. I'm Stephanie. I'm a Data Scientist working to help make the world a more accessible place to live.

I value Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Statistics used as a platform to demand change. Fluent in Pythonese, Memes, Puns, and Google. Extroverted Introvert looking for her people, in love with the idea of making the world a better place.

Avid photographer, enthusiastic knitter, will talk for hours about social psychology.
